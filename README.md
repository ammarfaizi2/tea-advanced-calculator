Try the calculator here: https://a10-s138-internal.teainside.org/teac.php

Note: The calculator accepts math expression in LaTex format.

I open the API for public here https://api.teainside.org/teacalc2.php?key=$key&expr=$expr

It doesn't need documentation to be used. You can just replace the $key with API key and $expr with URL encoded math expression written in LaTex.
